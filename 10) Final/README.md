* Problem 1 : Every time an EC2 turn on or off the IP changes.
* Problem 2: What if an instance fail ? you should have a backup instance using autoscaling.
* Problem 3: For database problme if an instance has shutdown the database data will be lost, so a snapshot for it will solve .
* Problem 4: what if the main and backup one failed --> queue.

when clone :
* Deployment key ?
* Use sysetmd unit .
* workign on reboot ?
* log file  for errors 

* Github action for CI/CD to use it in amplify for noticing changes on the EC2
